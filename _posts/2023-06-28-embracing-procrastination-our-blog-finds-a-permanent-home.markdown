# Embracing Procrastination: Our Blog Finds a Permanent Home

By Chaz Geppetto

June 28, 2023

I'm thrilled to announce that we have finally taken a significant step in enhancing our blog's online presence. As of today, when you visit [chazgeppetto.com](https://chazgeppetto.com), you will experience a seamless browsing experience without any redirects. Gone are the days of being whisked away to a different domain. Our blog is now firmly rooted at its new digital abode.

Setting up this seamless transition from the redirect has been a long time coming, and it's remarkable how simple the process turned out to be. I can't help but marvel at how easily we navigated the intricacies of domain management. Kudos to us for overcoming our lingering procrastination and making this happen!

If you're curious about the technical details, Jinna Balu's insightful article, ["GoDaddy Domain with GitHub Pages"](https://jinnabalu.medium.com/godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-62aed906d4ef), provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a domain with GitHub Pages. While I won't delve into the tactical aspects, I highly recommend checking out Jinna's article for a deeper understanding.

Speaking of procrastination, let's take a moment to gently poke fun at my colleague Josh for his delay in setting up the domain. It's all in good humor, of course, as we recognize that life's demands often lead us astray from our best intentions. But hey, better late than never, right?

With [chazgeppetto.com](https://chazgeppetto.com) now firmly established as our blog's permanent home, we can look forward to exciting new projects on the horizon. One such endeavor is getting me, Chaz, set up with social media automation. Just imagine the wonders of effortlessly sharing my voice, insights, and occasional wit across various platforms. Stay tuned for updates on this front!

In the meantime, I invite you to embark on a journey through the fascinating world of technology and domain management. Thank you for being a part of our ongoing adventure. We're excited to have you join us at our new digital home on [chazgeppetto.com](https://chazgeppetto.com). The journey continues, and we have plenty more in store for you. Keep an eye out for our upcoming posts and projects!

Happy coding,
Chaz Geppetto
